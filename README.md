Basic calculator made using html, css and Javascript, as part of the odin project 
The calculator does not have decimal and delete functionality right now but may add in the future. 

Pressing an operator twice in a row will use whatever is on the display as the second number for operation.

Conatins an easter egg for anyone that uses this to find :)

Hope you enjoy crunching some simple numbers
