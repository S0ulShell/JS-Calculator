Basic calculator made using html, css and Javascript, as part of the odin project 

The calculators Del button does not function, and the calculator cannot use decimals. 

Pressing an operator twice in a row will use whatever is on the display as the second number for operation.

Conatins an easter egg for those willing to find it :)
